      - acceleration => player's capacity to gain horizontal speed
      - groundingForce => constant downward force applied while grounded 
      - groundDeceleration => pace at which the player comes to stop
      - airDeceleration => deceleration in air only after stopping input mid-air
      - jumpPower => immediate velocity applied when jumping
      - maxFallSpeed => maximum vertical movement speed
      - fallAcceleration => player's capacity to gain fall speed
      - jumpEndGravityModifier => gravity multiplier added when jump is released early
      - coyoteTime => time before the coyote jump becomes unusable
      - jumpBuffer => amount of time we buffer a jump
